/**
 * Special window class to be used as a popup with child controls and a special border. It is
 * used as a "fly-out" or support window similar to tooltips showing e.g. larger amounts of text
 * and can act otherwise like a normal (but floating) window.
 * Other than the mforms popup class (which is meant for menus and the like) the popover cannot
 * be transparent and is non-modal.
 * Outer form, drop shadow etc. is provided by the platform implementations.
