Description: MySQL Workbench
 MySQL Workbench is development, administration and data modeling tool
 for MySQL. Besides editing and running SQL queries and scripts, it supports
 the design of MySQL databases through a EER diagram, which is then used to
 generate SQL scripts. Workbench also supports migration from many RDBMS
 products to MySQL.
