MySQL Workbench 6.3
-------------------

MySQL Workbench is a complete database modeling, administration and development program for MySQL.


This tree contains the source files for the MySQL Workbench 6.3.

MySQL Workbench is an extensible visual database design tool.


Buiding on Linux
----------------

To build MySQL Workbench on Ubuntu and other Debian based distros:

- Remove iodbc, if necessary

  $> sudo apt-get remove iodbc

- Install dependencies
  
  $> sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-data autoconf automake pkg-config libtool libzip-dev libxml2-dev \
                          libsigc++-2.0-dev libglade2-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx \
                          mesa-common-dev libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlcppconn-dev uuid-dev libpixman-1-dev libpcre3-dev \
                          libgnome2-dev libgnome-keyring-dev libgtk2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev python-dev \
                          libboost-dev libctemplate-dev mysql-client python-pysqlite2 libsqlite3-dev \
                          swig libvsqlitepp-dev libgdal-dev libproj0

- Extract the sources into a directory

  $> tar xvf mysql-workbench-community-<version>-src.tar.gz

- Go to the project and create a build directory

  $> cd mysql-workbench-community-<version>-src
  $> mkdir wb-build
  $> cd wb-build
  
- Build and install the project, and optionaly set the install prefix (should default to /usr/local)

  $> cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr] ..
  $> make
  $> sudo make install

- If you don't have permissions, you may install it on the current directory

  $> make install DESTDIR=.

Note about swig:
- You will need swig 1.3 to build WB

Note about antlr:
- Antlr 3.4 is needed, but the current release has many bugs. You will need it patched with https://github.com/antlr/antlr3/pull/43 if you don't want to use the bundled version.
  Then you'll need to 
      
      export ANTLR_JAR_PATH=<path_to_your_antlr_complete_file>

Note about iodbc:
 - instead of iodbc you can use unixodbc, to do that you need to install unixodbc and add -DUSE_UNIXODBC=True to cmake

Note about gdal:
 - Ubuntu Packages require unixodbc, so if you're using it, there won't be any problem. If you want to use iodbc, you'll need to build it from source.
 
Building on Windows
-------------------

To build on Windows, you need Visual Studio 2010 with C++ and C# support.
You also need the latest mysql-workbench-externals-1.0-win32 package, which
contains pre-compiled binaries of all the 3rd party libraries that Workbench 
depends on.

To Build:
- Unpack mysql-gui-win-res in the same top directory as Workbench itself
- Go to the mysql-workbench directory
- Open MySQLWorkbench.sln solution file
- Select Release_OSS or the Debug Configuration
- Select x86 as the Platform
- Build Project



Buiding on Mac OS X
-------------------

To Build:
- Go to http://rudix.org/ and download and install the following packages
  gettext, glib, libpng, libsigc++, lua, pkg-config, pcre, libzip, cairo, pixman
- Install MySQL 5.5.x 32bit (64bit will not work), make sure /usr/local/mysql
  points to the correct installation
- Install MySQL Connector/C++, vsqlite++
- Install Xcode 4.1.0 or later and open the MySQLWorkbench.xcodeproj file
- Select the OS X 10.6 and Debug or Release and build
